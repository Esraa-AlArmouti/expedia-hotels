 My instructions for setting the site up for expedia hotels as the following:
 1. Download  Java SE Development Kit 8u121.
 2. Download IntelliJ IDEA to create a java spring project.
 3. Create new repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Esraa-AlArmouti/expedia-hotels
 4. Create new app  on Heroku: expedia-hotels
 5. Clone the repository on Smartgit program.
 6. Create a new spring project named expedia-hotels
 7. to be honest with you I don't know JAVA but I tried to learn it these days but it's not enough so i thought that I could 
    do the task by using PHP instead since I'm more familiar with PHP than JAVA.
 8. I started creating form for hotel deals application and used bootstrap 3.3.7 for styling, Datepicker for calendar and JQuery by default.
 
 one of my assumptions for this website is making filter feature for finding the proper hotel offer
 in addition for the mentioned description of the task, I assume that the user want to book a car from the hotel "carPackage",
 minimum and maximum score for hotels car "carPackageScore", hotel language
 "distanceFromUser" by making a button checks the location for the user or take it from the browser itself and
 calculate the nearest hotel from the user.
 "numberOfRoomsLeft" by checking if the hotel is available or not, if it's not available it won't be shown in filtering but at this Jason example all room are full 
 so it won't show any result.
 "averagePriceValue" searching for a minimum price or maximum price
 "hotelTotalBaseRate" filtering the minimum and maximum base rate
 "hotelTotalTaxesAndFees" filtering the minimum and maximum total tax fees
 "hotelTotalMandatoryTaxesAndFees" filtering the minimum and maximum total mandotary tax fees
 "originalPricePerNight" filtering the minimum and maximum price per night
 "numberOfPeopleViewing" filtering the minimum and maximum people views
 "numberOfPeopleBooked" filtering the minimum and maximum people booked
 "movingAverageScore" filtering the minimum and maximum moving average score
 After all I assumed that the user can search for the best hotel deals according to the search requirement.
